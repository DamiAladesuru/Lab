    "The paper does not use a PP workflow but uses frequentist estimation methods. We will rebuild the entire research process using the PP workflow and estimate the quantities of interest using Bayesian methods. The paper conducts a survey with farmers to gather the data required for answering the research question. This could be similar to what you could do for your master's thesis. By working on the assignment, you practice how the PP workflow can be implemented for an actual research project. Additionally, it prepares you for applying it to your own research project.    \n",

    "*Heads up!* Be prepared that this will be quite a challenge and that for most of the questions there is not a single or clear-cut answer. Actually, an important learning outcome is that on the way to answering the research question, we need to make many (subjective) choices, and many alternative specifications or options would also be possible and justified. In terms of the grading, this means that the aim is not to find *one* correct answer (which does not exist) but rather to document and explain that you have thought about your choices and are aware of the implications.\n",

For alignment with DAG we could have considered $P$ and $G$ in the DAG, instead of just \"treatment\". Additionally, $X$ is not considered in DAG but in the statistical model. \n",
