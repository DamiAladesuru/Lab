# Lab

This repo contains all coding works directly related to my research or useful learnings for coding.

e.g under Learning, I have a folder for my first steps in Python with Socratica. Python is not so bad afterall. :)
Then, there is Niedersachsen which contains scripts for processing the 10 years data of Niedersachsen.
